## Hallmarks of Success

1. New knowledge is created.
    - doesn't necessarily mean that it's important.

2. Decisions or policies are made based on the outcome of the experiment.
    - if it produces actionable decisions or policies, that's even better.

3. A report, presentation or app with impact is created.
    - have great (positive) impact
    - create reusable code or apps

4. It is learned that the data can't answer the question being asked of it.

## Negative Outcomes

1. Decisions being made that disregard clear evidence from the data.

2. Equivocal results that do not shed light in one direction or another.

3. Uncertainty prevents new knowledge from being created.
