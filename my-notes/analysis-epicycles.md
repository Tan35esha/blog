## Epicycle of Analysis

For each of the core [process of a project](/project-process.md), it is critical that you engage in the following steps:

1. Setting Expectations,
2. Collecting information (data), comparing the data to your expectations, and if the expectations donâ€™t match,
3. Revising your expectations or fixing the data so your data and your expectations match.

----|Set Expectations|Collect Information|Revise Expections
Qestion|Qestion is of interest to audience|Literature Searche/Experts|Sharpen question|
EDA|Data are appropriate for question|Make exploratory plot of data|Refine question or collect more data|
Formal Modeling|Primary model answers question|Fit secondary models, sensitivity analysis|Revise formal model to include more predictors|
Interpretation|Provides a specific & meaningful answer|Totality of analyses with focus on effect size & uncertainty|Revise EDA/models to provide specific & interpretable answer|
Communication|Process & results of analysis are understood, complete & meaningful to audience|Seek feedback|Revise analyses or approach to presentation|
