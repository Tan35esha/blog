## Types of Questions
1. Descriptive statistics
    -  summarize a characteristic of a set of data
2. Exploratory data analysis
    - analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables.
    - are also called “hypothesis-generating” analyses
3. Inferential
    - a restatement of this proposed hypothesis as a question and would be answered by analyzing a different set of data.
4. Prediction
    - where you ask what types of people will eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables during the next year.
    - less interested in what causes someone to eat a certain diet, just what predicts whether someone will eat this certain diet.
5. Causal
    - asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor.
    - sometimes (in a random trail) the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows for the question that you ask to be causal
6. Mechanistic 
    - A question that asks how a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses.
