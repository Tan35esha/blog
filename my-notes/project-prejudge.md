## Tell Hype from Hope - What Worth Doing
There's been a lot of hype around these areas. We're sort of just now coming out into this sort of productive plateau, where people actually know what to do with data. It's a perfect time to start managing data scientist teams, managing expectations in a way that's really clear, and really focused.

Ask yourselves questions:
"What problem have you solved ever that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance? Where you didn't have a surplus of information and have to filter it out, or you didn't have insufficient information and have to go find some?"
    -- Dan Meyer

If someone comes to talk to you about a big data project, or a data science project, ask questions:
1. What is the question you are trying to anser with data?
2. Do you have the data to answer that question?
3. If you could answer the question, couldu use the answer?

Then you can very quickly decipher whether a data science project is about hype or whether it's about a real contribution that can really move your organisation forward.
