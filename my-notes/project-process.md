## Data science methodology
From [IBM data science professional certificate - data science methodology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-methodology/lecture/lMNmc/welcome) & [Executive Data Science Specialization- S1 & S2]



1. From Problem to Approach and from Requirements to Collection
- Business Understanding  
- Analytic Approach
- Data Requirements
- Data Collection


2. From Understanding to Preparation and from Modeling to Evaluation
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation

3. From Deployment to Feedback
- Deployment
- Feedback

## In General
From [Executive Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/executive-data-science)

- Data -> Exploratory data analysis -> Hypothesis generating

**Core**
---------------------------------------------

- Hypothesis/Question
    - ask the question and specify what is it that you're interested in learning from data.
    - specifying the question and refining it over time will guide you the data that you obtain and the [type of of analysis](analysit-types.md/) that you do.

    - Back to the previous step for (More Specific) Data 
        - have the data
        - go out and get it
        - someone will provide

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    - if the data that you have is suitable for ansering the question. (enough data? missing values? need to collect more data? ...)
    - start to develop a sketch of the solution to get a sense of kinda what it'll look like. (formal modeling, statistical testing...)
    - test with different dataset

May need repeating above.

- Formal Modeling
    - specifically write down what questions you're asking, what parameters you're trying to estimate.
    - challenge your results through a variety of approaches where the sensitivity analysis are other types of analysis and develop a framework.

- Interpretation
    - how your results fit what you expected to find when you first asking the question
    - to think about the totality of the evidence that you've developed, many different bits of information, part of the interpretation phase, and to assemble all that information to weigh the different pieces of evidence.

- Communication
    - internal to your orgnaization
    - external
    - a arge audience or few people

-------------------------------------------------------

- Dicision & Action

For each of the core process of a project, it is critical that you engage in [analysis-epicycles](/analysis-epicycles.md).

## Characteristics of a Good Question
- Of interest to your audience
    - Collaborators/Boss/Leadership
    - Scientific Community
    - Funders/Investors
    - General Public/Customers

- Not already answered

- Plausible
    
- Answerable




## EDA
### Goals of EDA
1. Do you have the right data?
2. Do you need to get more?
3. Do you need to refine your question?

### How
1. Read in the data, check the packaging.
    - check rows/columns
    - check for known or key variables
    - check all metadata or codebooks 

2. Check the edges.

3. Always be checking your Ns.
    - count the number of subjects,
