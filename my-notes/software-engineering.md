## Types
1. Just some code and document
    - write code at all is the first step
    - encapsulate automation with a loop or similar

2. Some sort of function
    - first level of abstraction
    - defined `interface`

3. Software package
    - API
    - Documentation

## Rules
1. Do it once: write some code and document
2. Do it twice: write a fuction
3. Do it three times: write a package with docs
