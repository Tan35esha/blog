"Data Science is a team sport" --D.J.Patil

## Data Engineers
A person that would maybe construct a database, or they might pull data out of that database for people to analyze. Or they might build production level machine learning algorithms and implement them on servers, so that they can be applied to a huge database of observations of data, and maybe even run in real time. So they have skills in infrastructure development, both the hardware side and the software side. And they do less of the actually analysis of the day to day data. That falls to the person that's called a data scientist.

## Data Scientists
Somebody that would go and pull data out of a database. Then they might analyze it, perform experiments on it, visualize it and communicate those results to the data science manager, and to other people in the organization to try and move things forward. Often, a data scientist will hand off any machine learning algorithm or prediction algorithm they develop, to the data engineer, who will then implement it so it can run at scale.

## Data Science Manager
The data science manager, makes sure that everybody interacts with each other and that they keep things moving. They also recruit and build the data science team. And then they also interface with upper management in an organization. As well as with collaborators that are at their same level across the organization, to make sure that they get all the information across. And they advertise the data science team to other people, what their capabilities are, what they can do, and how they can help out. 

## Communication Manager
They work together as a unit, and so often each of these people are working on individual projects, or individual subproblems of a data science problem. And then they come together and have joint group meetings and joint presentations, where they discuss their ideas. They also interact with external folks, they might interact with those people directly through individual meetings with people outside of the data science team. Or they might interact through the data science manager. So, in either way they have to be able to communicate what's going on with the data science infrastructure, what's going on with the data science team. And how do they make sure that all the problems are getting solved.
